# Gender Prediction
After completing the A-Z Machine Learning Course by Kirill Eremenko in Udemy, I tried to work a small project to predict the gender of a person based on a picture provided.

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and consisted of approx 2800 training examples and 500 test examples of pictures of man and woman. I used tf.keras.models.Sequential() and implemented a CNN model with three hidden layers and 'relu' activation function. The model was compiled with 'adam' optimizer and with 25 epochs, the accuracy came out to be 83.48 %.
